# Multi-Domain Multi-Modality I2I translation

Pytorch implementation of multi-modality I2I translation for multi-domains. The project is an extension to the "Diverse Image-to-Image Translation via Disentangled Representations(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00948)", ECCV 2018.
With the disentangled representation framework, we can learn diverse image-to-image translation among multiple domains.
